	<h2>Project Idea</h2>
	<div class="main-content">

		<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p>Over the last five years working an aquatic centre with a state-of-the-art timing system. The only holding the swim meet back it the software running the meet. There is only one popular software all club, state and national level competition use "Meet Manager by Hytek". Feedback from many users of this program has been poor or they say, “it not user friendly”.</p>
			<p>Meet Manager has been unchanged for many years. The possible reason there has been no change or competitor as it works well many different timing software around the world at the highest level of swimming.</p>
		<h3>Motivation</h3>
			<p>There are about 1100 swim clubs around Australia and many more around the world. The most popular software most swim clubs are using is Meet Manager by Hytek. This leaves a gap for new and innovative software to be produced in Australia.</p>
			<p>Due to the stake of running a swim meet at the highest level of competition, change and adoption of new software is slow. The current system is slow and unchanged for many years. As manual and automatic timing systems has changed over the years the program that runs the meet has not changed with it. The continual year subscription is also a barrier for many clubs and school to purchase this software.</p>
		<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>The MeetOrg can organise swimmers into events and heats. This will enable the running a swimming carnival. MeetOrg will need to integrate with old hardware to make this product more cost effective for all clubs.</p>
			<p>MeetOrg will have ability to import large number of swimmers, using excel or similar product, without having to enter each swimmer individually. This will decrease administration hours manually entering swimmers into the meet. User will be also be able to add events to swimmers via excel, using the import function, import them into MeetOrg.MeetOrg will need to import meet entries that have been created using other programs such as Meet Manager and Swim Central (Australia entries and result database).</p>
			<p>With MeetOrg events will need to created for swim meets. With these events the user will need to have the ability to choose if:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Touchpads are on both ends</li>
				<li>Number of lanes</li>
				<li>If this event was ranked by divisional</li>
				<li>Gender</li>
				<li>Stroke</li>
				<li>Distance</li>
				<li>Relay or individual</li>
				<li>And many more</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This program will need to be able to communicate with current manual and automatic timing systems such as Wylas, Dolphin and Quantum. These programs will sent the time they have collected to MeetOrg. Times will then need to sort by times and place and scores given to each swimmer or team.</p>
			<p>Part of every meet a meet program will need to created for swimmers, parents, coaches and referees. Reports will also need to be create for marshalling all the swimmers in the correct event and heat. A finally result will need to created with point scores for each swimmer and team. Other reports would useful is to create team reports for relays.</p>
			<p>This new meet organiser will need to have the ability to organise swimmers into their events and heats by their entry time or seed the swimmers.</p>
			<p>When running the meet, we user will need to be able to edit events. Import results from different races into the same event. The ability to move, change and add swimmers in the middle of a meet and under pressure.</p>
			<p>This program will also need to have ability to export into a format that another meet organiser program can understand. These results will be sent to the governing body of the event for example, in a swim meet the results will be sent to Swimming NSW to make an official.</p>
			<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic cause an increase in number of people wanting results to be live. The MeetOrg will need to able to import results from the timing system. Sort the results and export the results to the internet.</p>
		<h3>Tools and Technology</h3>
			<p>MeetOrg will be a web-based program. As a result, users will need a computer with an internet connection. The web-based program will need to be integrated into other timing software. Software such as Wylas, Dolphin and Quantum. Wylas can be connected by Wi-Fi or ethernet. Ethernet connection will also be the backup connection if the Wi-Fi fails.</p>
			<p>Whereas Quantum will need to be connected by some type of adaptor to connect to the web-based interface. This connector can be like the adaptor Quantum has currently.</p>
			<p>Reactor or angular can be used for the web interface. This will allow many more users using different types of devices such as Windows and Mac computers.</p>
		<h3>Skill Requirement</h3>
			<p>Creating this requirement, a large amount of research on need to be performed to be able to integrate between MeetOrg and other timing system both manual and automatic timing systems. The integration with Wylas will be more easier than other system as I currently use at our aquatic centre to run most of our swim meets. Were as the other timing systems will be harder to understand if they do not want to release their information.</p>
			<p>Need to learn a web-based software such as reactor or angular. Currently have not worked with either software. Learning maybe using online learning tools or at a university.</p>
		<h3>Outcome</h3>
			<p>If this project was successful, the adoption would be slow. As the current system (Meet Manager) has been tried and tested and has been proven to work. Especially at the highest level of swimming (National and State level).</p>
			<p>The first adopter would be smaller clubs and schools. Hopefully with the ease of use would allow more users to run their own meets. The adaptability of the program will allow more clubs to use that they have and not need to purchase new hardware. This will reduce the cost to the clubs who what to move away from manually timing and reduce the number of errors.</p>
