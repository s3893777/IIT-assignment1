			<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
			<p>My inerest IT probably started a young age. Had many ambitious of creating websites and databases. I did not want to purse a career in information technology, as a young dumb adult, I believed that you had to be behind a desk at all time. Obviously I was WRONG! </p>
			<p>Currently working in the Aquatic Industry I found many programs that was created for the industry was an "after thought". Most programs we are archanic and requires a face lift. I would like to find solutions make organising swim school and squads and run a swim meet that are Australian-based.</p>
			<p>Pervious I have built a raspberry-pi magic mirror noticeboard as I did not want to purchase a Google Nest for my dad. It shows family events, family photo album and other interesting things. Another IT project was builting a NAS device from old hardware. The NAS device started as backup and share drive for the my family. The other reason I built the NAS is to have local sercuity system. I don't ready want to pay a subscription.</p>
